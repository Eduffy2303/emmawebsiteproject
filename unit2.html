      <h4>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h4>
           <p>The first page contains information about myself. The navigation bar is located in the top left corner and displays links to my website pages; about me, unit 1 and unit 2. The second page contains all questions and answers for unit one, however unlike the first page, the navigation bar also contains jump links to the different outcomes on the page. The third page contains all questions and answers for unit 2, along with the navigation bar similar to the first page.</p>
      <h4>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h4>
          <p>Copyright and other constraints often restrict what websites are able to publish. For example, to use an image, one must gain permission from the original owner or artist. Also, if a website uses information from another site they must link to the original.

      <h4>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
            people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome
            them</h4>
             <p>To overcome issues that people with disabilities face, we can add features such as an accessibility guide, showing the different ways the website is or can be made accessible. For people using a screen reader, it is important to use alt tags on images so individuals with visual impairment can also experience the website. Using full stops in abbreviations and providing a description in links can also improve accessibility for people using screen readers. Setting the website out simply and making it as neat and clean as possible is also important. [1]

      <h4>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>
         <p>There are many different file types you can use for websites. HTML is the standard markup language for creating websites. CSS is used along with HTML to stylise the web pages and make them look presentable. As most people have access to a javascript-enabled browsers nowadays, using javascript is also appropriate. For images, JPEG images, PNG images and GIFs are the most appropriate.</p>

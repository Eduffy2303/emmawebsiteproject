        <h4>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
        <p>IT has a very significant role in modern business. As technology advances, it is being utilised more and more in business settings. For example, businesses use IT to their advantage for:
        </p>
    
        <ul id="list">
            <li>Market research;</li>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Online surveys and social media presence are excellent methods of learning more about the company's customers.</li>

                </ul>
            <li>Customer support;</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Support for customers has become increasingly more accessible with the introduction of email, online chat support and support social media accounts.
                   </li>
                 </ul>
            <li>Marketing;</li>   
                 <ul>
                     <li>Marketing has improved greatly through the use of IT. Businesses are able to reach a wider audience with things such as online advertising.</li>
                 </ul>  
        </ul>
         
    

    
        <h4>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What
skills?</h4>
            <p>For digital projects to be successful, it is important to come up with a method of how and when tasks are going to be completed (for example: plan, research, code, etc.). Skills such as problem solving and organisation are also important. When working in a team, it’s best to work with people of different skill sets so all skills needed can be covered, and members can support each other. Resources are also significant, for example a good computer with the appropriate software such as Visual Studio Code (depending on what the project is).</p>
    

    
        <h4>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h4>
            <p>I will plan and carry out tasks with IT using Google docs and Trello. I'll create a Trello board to plan and keep up to date with certain tasks. I'll colour code the questions on Trello by unit and outcome. I will also include a review section to ensure everything is double checked.

        <h4>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
            projects to fail? Why?</h4>
            <p>There are several risks that might impact digital projects. One risk factor that impacts digital projects is failing to plan. Being unprepared for the unexpected and not addressing known risks can hinder the progress of a digital project. This is why it is important to plan ahead and have measures in place in case something does go wrong [1]. Another risk factor is lack of communication within a team. Communication allows the project to be completed quicker, more accurately and more efficiently as everyone understands their role.

        <h4>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
        how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h4>
            <p>Copyright and other constraints often restrict what websites are able to publish. For example, to use an image, one must gain permission from the original owner or artist. If a website uses information from another site they must link to the original to give them credits if they receive consent to use it.</p>

    
            <h4>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
            achieve your outcomes.</h4>
                <p>Trello has helped me keep up to date with what needs doing and what has been done, keeping every task organised. I used git and GitHub for my code version control, storing my code in the repository. I could upload my code whenever I modified it, and access it on GitHub if I wanted, for example, to access it and edit it outside the classroom. This was also a great way to back up my code versions, incase I had to return to one or I lost my code. </p>
    

    
        <h4>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
                GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>
                <p>"The mutually agreed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on May 25, 2018, and was designed to modernise laws that protect the personal information of individuals"[1]. These new laws can greatly affect digital projects. For example, digital businesses now have to design data flows and reduce collected data to the absolute minimum. Previously companies would have stored customer data for future use (marketing, sales, etc.), however that is no longer allowed. Any GDPR infringements may result in large financial sanctions, so digital businesses must be very mindful of how they handle customer’s data.[2]

        <h4>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
            </h4>
                 <p>I believe that the tools I used were very suitable for the task at hand. Visual Studio Code was very helpful due to features like autocomplete and suggestion, which for a beginner at html and css was convenient as less mistakes were made. However, the autocomplete could be bothersome at times when going back to the code and editing, so perhaps next time I would try it without the autocomplete. Trello was also very helpful and allowed me to keep up to date with tasks, and Google Docs allowed me to write out my answers in full before adding them to my website.</p>
    

    
        <h4>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h4>
            <p>The IT tools selected were appropriate for the task of creating a website. For example, Visual Studio Code, as I’ve previously stated, is very convenient for a beginner at html and css due to it’s autocomplete and suggestion feature. Trello was also appropriate for this task however I think it’d only be useful for someone who enjoys being organised. 
            </p>
    

    
        <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
             <p>The website I have created is fully functioning, simple and easy to use. However, it looks slightly plain so next time I would maybe add some images and icons. My code for the website is also quite untidy in some areas, so I’d change it to make it a bit more readable for myself. There are also features I would’ve liked to add but didn’t possess the skills for. Overall, I’m fairly happy with my website.
            </p>

    
        <h4>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h4>
           <p>There are a couple of improvements I would add to improve my website. Firstly, I would make my navigation bar ‘sticky’, so it stays in place in the top left corner as the user scrolls. This would improve my jump links because at the moment the user has to scroll back up to get to the navigation bar. Secondly, another improvement I’d make to my navigation bar is adding an active page link, so the user knows which page they’re on.
        </p>
    

    
        <h4>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h4>
           <p>My website matches the requirements of the outcomes. For example, I used CSS in Visual Studio Code to set out my page clearly with the side navigation bar at the top , and made the titles and questions stand out this fulfils the requirement “2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation”. Furthermore, I used HTML to create links for the navigation bar to allow users to find each page of the website. This fulfils the requirement  “2.4 Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages”.

        <h4>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </h4>
            <p>Making the website could have been completed quicker and more efficiently in teams. I often found myself making small mistakes that sometimes took me a while to find. These small mistakes could’ve been identified and fixed much quicker and accurately had there been other team members to review my code.</p>
    
        <h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>
           <p>Productivity and efficiency can be improved by completely planning out exactly how you want the website to look, for example by drawing it out. By doing this you can be more organised and thus be more productive. Having a plan means you spend less time trying different things out because you already have an idea to execute. Another way to improve productivity and efficiency is to commit to one task at a time. Doing several tasks at once can slow you down and reduce accuracy.</p>

        <h4>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
                would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4>
                 <p>Next time I would utilise Trello more by adding deadlines to my tasks. Without giving certain tasks a certain day to be completed I’ve felt quite unorganised and I’ve been going back and forth to different tasks, unintentionally leaving the harder ones until last when I should’ve completed them first. Furthermore, I would have planned out exactly how I wanted my website to look instead of simply planning it in my head. Team work would have also greatly improved the project as different ideas could’ve been formed. 
                </p>

        <h4>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h4>
           <p>To test digital solutions I would test different codes and see how they look and work on a browser, using different browsers to ensure the code works universally. However there are some limitations when it comes to testing. For example, since I catered my website to my own personal tastes, I might consider a test as successful but an actual user of the site may consider it unsuccessful as it doesn’t satisfy their needs.

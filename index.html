      <h1 class="center">About Me</h1>
        <p class="center meMeBigBoy">My name is Emma, I’m 21 years old and I’m from Manchester. I’ve been struggling to figure out exactly what career path I want to go down, so I decided to enrol on the Develop: Coding course at Code Nation. I’ve taken an interest in IT and coding in the past so this seemed like an excellent opportunity that I couldn’t pass up. My experience at code nation so far has been very enjoyable and I can definitely see myself going into this line of work.</p>
